I want to use simple data to find value that goes unnoticed to push for new frontiers. My Story \u00b6 I grew up in Petaluma, California which is about 45 minutes north of San Francisco. I have a dad who works in animation, a mom who went back to school 15 years ago to be a nurse, an older brother doing a PhD in Planetary Science, three younger sisters, and an amazing wife. When I was 18, I left my home to serve a two year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Northern France. I still take every opportunity to use my French, even if its listening to Harry Potter audiobook in French. When I got back, I attended Brigham Young University in Utah, studying Applied and Computational Mathematics, mostly because I was good at Math in high school, I did not quite know what I wanted to do, and applying Math sounded a lot more interesting than not applying it. I graduated after 4 years, and while I was there I learned that programming was fun, I got married, and I taught French 101 for 2.5 years. I now am the proud owner of a 6 month-old English Bulldog \"Bear\", and in my free time I work on the types of things you'll see on this sight: work at the intersection of Statistics, Economics, Machine Learning, Fun code, and creating random things on a computer.
